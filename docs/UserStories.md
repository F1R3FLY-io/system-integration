# User Stories

<!--
TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
0. Update frontmatter: set last_updated to current date, increment version for structural changes
1. Add completed stories under "Completed Stories" section
2. Add planned stories under "Planned Stories" section
3. Move completed stories from "Planned" to "Completed" sections
4. Update epoch links when implementation begins
5. Check acceptance criteria as features are verified
6. (Optional) Update reference URLs if using a fork with modified standards
7. Remove these usage instruction comments before committing
-->

This document captures user stories that drive feature development. User stories are reverse-engineered from completed epochs and updated as new features are planned.

**Document Structure**
- Active stories: This file (`docs/UserStories.md`)
- Implementation tracking: `docs/ToDos.md` (epochs and tasks)
- Completed work: `docs/CompletedTasks.md`

**Format:** Each story follows the standard template:
> As a [persona], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

**User Stories Standard Reference** (canonical):

## Planned Stories

Stories below are candidates for future epochs. Move to "Completed Stories" when implemented.

<!-- Add planned user stories here -->

## Story Template

Use this template when adding new user stories:

```markdown
#### US-XXX: [Short Title]

> As a **[persona]**, I want **[capability]** so that **[benefit]**.

**Implemented in:** [EPOCH-ID or "Planned"]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Completed:** [Date or "Planned"]
```

## Relationship to Epochs

User stories capture the **why** (user need and benefit). Epochs capture the **what** (technical implementation tasks).

| Artifact | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| User Story | Business/user need | `docs/UserStories.md` |
| Epoch | Implementation scope | `docs/ToDos.md` |
| Task | Technical work item | Nested in epoch YAML |
| Acceptance Criteria | Definition of done | In user story |

**Workflow:**
1. Identify user need -> Create user story
2. Design solution -> Create epoch with tasks
3. Implement -> Work through tasks via `/nextTask` and `/implement`
4. Complete -> Mark epoch complete, update story status
