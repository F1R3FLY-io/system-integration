# Build configuration for services
builds:
  f1r3node:
    # Main build command (compiles Scala and stages executable)
    build_command: "sbt stage"

    # Alternative: Clean build
    # build_command: "sbt clean stage"

    # Docker build command (includes Rust library compilation)
    docker_build_command: "sbt node/docker:publishLocal"

    # Build environment
    environment: "nix"  # Uses nix develop shell

    # Pre-build steps for regular builds
    pre_build_steps:
      - "./scripts/build_rust_libraries.sh"  # Native build
      # Or for cross-platform: "./scripts/build_rust_libraries_docker.sh"

    # Pre-build steps for Docker builds (runs in Nix environment)
    docker_pre_build_steps:
      - "rustup default stable"  # Configure Rust toolchain

    # Docker image produced
    docker_image: "f1r3flyindustries/f1r3fly-rust-node:latest"

    # Build dependencies
    dependencies:
      - "sbt"
      - "cargo"
      - "rustc"
      - "nix (optional but recommended)"

    # Notes:
    # - Uses SBT (Scala Build Tool) as primary build system
    # - Requires Rust for native libraries (rspace, rholang)
    # - Nix flake provides complete dev environment: nix develop
    # - Multi-architecture support: AMD64 and AARCH64
    # - Docker entrypoint auto-detects architecture

  rust-client:
    # Main build command
    build_command: "cargo build --release"

    # No dedicated Docker build (CLI tool that connects to f1r3node)
    docker_build_command: null

    # Binary location after build
    binary_path: "target/release/node_cli"

    # Build dependencies
    dependencies:
      - "cargo"
      - "rustc >= 1.85.0"

    # Notes:
    # - Pure Rust CLI application
    # - Connects to F1R3FLY nodes (typically running in Docker)
    # - No containerization needed - runs locally
    # - Uses f1r3fly-models, f1r3fly-crypto, f1r3fly-rholang dependencies
